This is a basic implementation of a reactive system using Signals based on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWB3vTWeLd4 (basically the Observer pattern but without the explicit `.subscribe` and `.notify`).

I used this to see if MobX could be replaced by WASM and C++ after dealing with major breaking changes during my time at TrueContext.
